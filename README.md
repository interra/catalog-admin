# Interra Data Admin 

Creates an administrative interface for creating and managing open data catalogs. Initial pre-pre alpha is here: https://interra-data.herokuapp.com/

Features will include standard open data catalog capabilties including managing multiple sites, datasets and resources, basic pages, and more.

Provides an API that can save data in Mongo or JSON files. Plan is to have dataset metadata stored directly in JSON files. However this easy-to-use interface could be used as a front-end for other catalogs. Schema for datasets will be driven by JSON Schema. This will make it easy to adopt new schemas or modify existing schemas.

## About Interra Data

Interra Data is an Open Data Catalog powered by static JSON files. Using static files as the metadata store makes publishing and updating data easier and more efficient.

Interra Data is similar to [JKAN](https://jkan.io/). The main conceptual difference is it is created to run as a service that is not coupled to Github Pages.

Interra Data consists of two major decoupled components.

* [Data Admin](https://github.com/interra/data-admin) which allows non-technical users to sign-up and create and manage a catalog. Data generated by Data Admin is stored in JSON files.
* [Data Generate](https://github.com/interra/data-generate) which generates a data catalog from JSON files.

## Architecture

### Server
Server built off of [Aqua]() using HapiJS. Front-end is built using React.

### JSON Schema
The schema for the datasets will be driven by JSON Schema. To render the form we will use [React JSON Schema Form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form).

This should make it easy to add to existing schemas or adopt new ones.
